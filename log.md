### Day 1: May 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I went back onto github where i found this 100 days of code sheet, i have reaccessed my free code camp projects and also some items on code pen. 
Today i am going to redo from scratch the buildup of a bbc news website. I am on a course from udemy under rob percible. Previosuly i copied what he did in the tutorial now i want to do it on my own. 

**Thoughts:** Having recently completed a seperate tutourial on flex box to make a column / row i need to work out what is better to use. on udemy the gent is making everything from scratch using float: left and adding items to suit. What is the better option?

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
