# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Start Again - 10/05/2020

** Started in december 2019 and got quite far in HTML and CSS - due to work commitments and eventually a lack of focus i stopped the codinng practise this ended around february

Restarted During the lockdown Period of covid 19. The below is from on twitter what will be day 8 but on here is day 1 as thats when ve started again.

### Day 1: May 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I went back onto github where i found this 100 days of code sheet, i have reaccessed my free code camp projects and also some items on code pen. 
Today i am going to redo from scratch the buildup of a bbc news website. I am on a course from udemy under rob percible. Previosuly i copied what he did in the tutorial now i want to do it on my own. 

**Thoughts:** Having recently completed a seperate tutourial on flex box to make a column / row i need to work out what is better to use. on udemy the gent is making everything from scratch using float: left and adding items to suit. What is the better option?

### Day 2: May 11, 2020
#### Refresh and refocus

**Today's Progress**: Decided after reading a coding book that although i know the bulk of the main html and css functions i cannot recall them if i need to. Only after spending about 20 minuites trying to find out how to do soemething i realise o already knew that. So i have now made a folder with examples of all main tags and functions for HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts**: I needed to declutter, i have many different sources of information that im using and many different applications. I have now shortcutted everything so that i can access all easily and effectively.

### Day 3: May 12, 2020
#### Refresh and refocus

**Today's Progress**: Had to work today for the first time since lockdown. Installed some sneeze screens so was worthwhile work. When i got back only really looked through one tof the text books. Not much porogress

**Thoughts**: Productive day in 1 sense and defo no in another

### Day 4: May 13, 2020
#### Refresh and refocus

**Today's Progress**: Did quite a lot on my example page. Made a lot of comments and will finish the html by tomorrow. Will be good to start the css

**Thoughts**: By doing each elemtn seperately and in all aaspects of it (for example the form tags i am seperateley adding all different types) i have a much better understanding of how they work now. 

### Day 5: May 14, 2020
#### Refresh and refocus

**Today's Progress**: Will have the HTML Complete by today and hopefully get into the CSS

**Thoughts**: By going back and updating this log every day is actually helping keep on track. Even if no one else ever looks at it. I nknow that this is here.
